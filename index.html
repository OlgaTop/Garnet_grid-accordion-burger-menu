                  than 100 phytochemicals. The pomegranate fruit has been used

                <h3 class="benefits_subtitle">1. Antioxidants</h3>
                <p class="benefits_desc">
                  Pomegranates have been eaten throughout history for their
                  health benefits. Nowadays, the juice of this fruit is a
                  popular part of healthy diets.
                </p>
                <p class="benefits_desc">
                  Pomegranate seeds get their vibrant red hue from polyphenols.
                  These chemicals are powerful antioxidants.
                </p>
                <p class="benefits_desc">
                  Pomegranate juice contains higher levels of antioxidants than
                  most other fruit juices. It also has three times more
                  antioxidants than red wine and green tea. The antioxidants in
                  pomegranate juice can help remove free radicals, protect cells
                  from damage, and reduce inflammation.
                </p>
                <h3 class="benefits_subtitle">2. Vitamin C</h3>
                <p class="benefits_desc">
                  The juice of a single pomegranate has more than 40 percent of
                  your daily requirement of vitamin C. Vitamin C can be broken
                  down when pasteurized, so opt for homemade or fresh
                  pomegranate juice to get the most of the nutrient.

                  While there haven't been long-term studies with humans that

                  Pomegranate juice can reduce inflammation in the gut and

                  While there are conflicting beliefs and research on whether
                  pomegranate juice helps or worsens diarrhea, most doctors
                  recommend avoiding it until you are feeling better and your

                  Pomegranate juice is a powerful anti-inflammatory because of
                  its high concentration of antioxidants. It can help reduce
                  inflammation throughout the body and prevent oxidative stress

                  Pomegranate juice is in the running as the most heart-healthy

                </p>
                <p class="benefits_desc">
                  Small studies have shown that the juice improves blood flow
                  and keeps the arteries from becoming stiff and thick. It may
                  also slow the growth of plaque and buildup of cholesterol in
                  the arteries. But pomegranate may react negatively with blood
                  pressure and cholesterol medications like statins.
                </p>
                <p class="benefits_desc">
                  Be sure to talk with your doctor before indulging in the juice
                  or taking a pomegranate extract supplement.
                </p>
                <h3 class="benefits_subtitle">9. Blood pressure</h3>

                  Drinking pomegranate juice daily may also help lower systolic

                  health to include pomegranate juice daily.

                  Pomegranate juice can reduce inflammation in the gut and
                  improve digestion. It may be beneficial for people with
                  Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and other inflammatory
                  bowel diseases.

                  While there are conflicting beliefs and research on whether
                  pomegranate juice helps or worsens diarrhea, most doctors
                  recommend avoiding it until you are feeling better and your
                  symptoms have subsided.
